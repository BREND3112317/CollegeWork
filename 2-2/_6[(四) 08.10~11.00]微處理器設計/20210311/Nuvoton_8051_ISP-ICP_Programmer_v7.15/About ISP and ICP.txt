*** About the ISP (In-System Programming):

ISP is implemented by software control of MCU itself. There needs a loader code,
i.e., the ISP-code, pre-programmed in MCU's LDROM for ISP operation. The 'ISP Programmer'
and 'ISP by COM Port' use the ISP function to update the MCU chip.


*** About the ICP (In-Circuit Programming):

ICP is implemented by hardware control. There doesn't need any loader code
pre-programmed in the MCU. The 'ICP Programmer' uses the ICP function to update
the MCU chip.
